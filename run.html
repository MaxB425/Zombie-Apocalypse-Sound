        <p>But inevitably it doesn't work,</p>
        <p>he then bites into you and then you kill it with your saw. You escape through the back window and travel to an alleyway between the buildings with no zombies.</p>
        <p>You survived, but then again... you're bitten which can mean anything.</p>
